# ONCHAINID

## **Overview**

***

ONCHAINID is a universal identity framework built to support the identification, verification, and management of digital identities on the blockchain. It leverages the ERC734 (Key Manager) and ERC735 (Claim Holder) standards to create a decentralized and interoperable identity system that can be used across various blockchain networks and applications. With ONCHAINID, digital identities can be easily managed, verified, and used to interact with both on-chain and off-chain services, making it an ideal solution for regulated financial environments and Web3 applications.

ONCHAINID simplifies identity management by enabling users to have a single, blockchain-based identity that can be used across multiple services and ecosystems. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage claims (such as KYC verifications, legal identifiers, or credentials) while maintaining user privacy.

## **How ONCHAINID Works**

***

ONCHAINID functions as a decentralized identity management system by combining two key components:

1. **ERC734 (Key Manager)**\
   This standard allows the management of keys associated with an identity. Keys can be used for various purposes, such as signing transactions, accessing data, or verifying claims. The ERC734 standard makes it easy to update or remove keys, ensuring that users maintain control over their digital identities.
2. **ERC735 (Claim Holder)**\
   ERC735 facilitates the management of claims associated with an identity. Claims are pieces of information or credentials that are issued by trusted parties. For example, a KYC provider can issue a claim that verifies an individual’s identity, which can then be used for accessing services or complying with regulations.

Together, these standards form a robust framework for identity management that supports secure, decentralized, and interoperable digital identities.

## **Enhancing ONCHAINID with MetaKeep**

***

By integrating MetaKeep's cryptographic services and infrastructure, ONCHAINID's capabilities are significantly enhanced, providing an even more secure, user-friendly, and scalable solution for managing digital identities. Here’s how MetaKeep improves ONCHAINID:

1. **Advanced Security with Hardware Root of Trust**\
   MetaKeep's infrastructure utilizes a hardware root of trust to secure all cryptographic operations. This ensures that private keys and sensitive identity data are never exposed outside of the secure hardware environment. By leveraging this zero-trust model, ONCHAINID users can have confidence that their identities and associated claims are managed with the highest levels of security.
2. **Frictionless User Experience through Email-Based Access**\
   MetaKeep enables ONCHAINID to offer email-driven access to digital identities, simplifying the onboarding and identity management process. Users can easily register and manage their ONCHAINID using just their email, eliminating the need to handle private keys or complex cryptographic concepts. This approach reduces barriers to adoption while maintaining security and compliance.
3. **Gasless Transactions for Identity Operations**\
   MetaKeep's gasless architecture abstracts blockchain transaction fees away from users, allowing identity-related operations such as key management, claim issuance, and verification to be performed without incurring transaction costs. This results in a more seamless and cost-effective experience, particularly for high-volume identity use cases.
4. **Scalability for Large-Scale Identity Management**\
   MetaKeep's infrastructure is built to handle millions of transactions, making it suitable for large-scale identity management scenarios. Whether onboarding thousands of users or managing a network of identity claims, MetaKeep ensures that ONCHAINID remains performant and reliable as demand grows.

## **Use Cases for ONCHAINID at Chainstarters**

***

1. **KYC/AML Compliance**\
   ONCHAINID, enhanced by MetaKeep, can be used to streamline KYC and AML processes by securely managing verified claims about user identities. This is essential for regulated industries where compliance is mandatory, such as financial services and tokenized securities.
2. **Decentralized Identity for Web3 Applications**\
   Web3 applications that require identity verification can leverage ONCHAINID to authenticate users without relying on centralized identity providers. By integrating MetaKeep, Chainstarters ensures that these identities are not only decentralized but also highly secure and easy to use.
3. **Cross-Platform Identity Interoperability**\
   With support for multiple blockchain networks and MetaKeep's gasless architecture, ONCHAINID can be used to enable cross-platform identity interoperability, allowing users to maintain a consistent identity across various services and ecosystems. This is particularly beneficial for applications that operate on multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.

## **Conclusion**

***

ONCHAINID provides a robust framework for decentralized identity management, enabling users to securely manage and verify their digital identities. By integrating MetaKeep, Chainstarters enhances ONCHAINID with advanced cryptographic security, gasless transactions, and frictionless user experiences, making it a powerful solution for Web3 identity management and compliance.
