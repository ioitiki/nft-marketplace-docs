# Welcome!

## Welcome to Chainstarters Developer Docs

Welcome to Chainstarters! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with the Chainstarters APIs. While this documentation discusses a set of GraphQL APIs, which could in general have multiple language implementations, all of this documentation is at this time focused on a library written for browser and nodejs based typescript projects. All examples are written in TypeScript to provide the most comprehensive tutorials.

## Want to jump right in?

Feeling like an eager beaver? Jump in to the quick start docs and get making your first request:

{% content-ref url="api-reference/graphql-api-reference/collections/create-a-collection.md" %}
[create-a-collection.md](api-reference/graphql-api-reference/collections/create-a-collection.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:

{% content-ref url="api-reference/graphql-api-reference/" %}
[graphql-api-reference](api-reference/graphql-api-reference/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
